A React Native app (targeted to mobile, exportable to web) with react-native-paper that consumes an API in order to provide user logging.
The app provides field checking for various fields like email, birthdate, password compliance and matching, romanian CNP (Numerical Personal Code) which also contains the birth date and must match.
The app was developed to consume an existing API that might no longer exist in the future; I marked the places where the API URL is used with TODO.
